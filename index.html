        <h2>Project Overview: Student Mental Health Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to analyze various mental health factors affecting students, including stress, anxiety, and depression, and their relationship with academic performance, substance use, and access to mental health resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this project, we discovered significant trends in student mental health. Some of the major findings include a strong correlation between academic performance and stress levels, as well as the impact of substance use on mental well-being.

            <p class="description">
                This bar plot visualizes the distribution of various features such as gender, course enrollment, and counseling service use. It reveals that female students use mental health resources more frequently than male students. This suggests that females may be more inclined to seek help, potentially due to social stigma or higher awareness about mental health support. Understanding these patterns can help in identifying gender-based disparities and creating targeted interventions to ensure equal access to mental health services.

            <p class="description">
                The correlation heatmap visually represents the relationships between stress, anxiety, depression, and academic performance. Strong correlations between stress, anxiety, and depression suggest that students experiencing higher stress are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. This highlights the need for integrated mental health services that address multiple factors simultaneously. Additionally, the mild negative correlation between stress levels and CGPA implies that students with better academic performance may experience lower stress levels.

            <p class="description">
                This scatter plot investigates the relationship between CGPA and stress levels. The data reveals that students with lower CGPA tend to report higher stress levels. This suggests that students struggling academically may face additional emotional and mental health challenges. It underscores the importance of providing academic support and stress management resources for students with lower academic performance to reduce their overall stress levels and improve their well-being.

            <p class="description">
                The pie chart shows the distribution of substance use among students. It highlights that a significant number of students engage in occasional or regular use of alcohol or recreational drugs. The prevalence of substance use raises concerns about its impact on mental health, as substance use is often linked with anxiety, depression, and stress. Addressing this issue by promoting healthy coping mechanisms and providing education on the risks of substance use can significantly improve students' mental well-being.

            <p class="description">
                This line chart illustrates how stress levels change with age. It shows that older students report higher stress levels, which could be due to increased academic pressures, career preparations, and family responsibilities. The findings suggest that stress management programs should be tailored to students at different stages of their academic journey, with special attention given to older students who may face additional stressors beyond academics.

            <p class="description">
                The histogram displays the distribution of stress levels among students. It shows that a large proportion of students report moderate to high stress levels, which indicates a widespread issue. This suggests that mental health resources should be accessible and proactive, especially for students who fall into the high-stress category. The data calls for university-wide mental health initiatives to help manage stress across the student population.

            </div>
            <p class="description">
                The histogram illustrates the distribution of CGPA scores among students. Most students fall into the mid-range CGPA, with fewer students achieving very high or low scores. This distribution can help identify students who may require additional academic support. Further research could investigate how CGPA relates to mental health issues such as anxiety and stress, especially among students with low academic performance.

            <p class="description">
                This box plot compares stress levels across genders. The data shows that females report higher stress levels compared to males, with a wider range of stress levels among females. This may indicate that females experience a greater variability in stress, possibly due to different academic and social pressures. Addressing gender-specific stressors through targeted support can help reduce these disparities and improve the overall mental health of female students.

                The correlation matrix shows that stress, anxiety, and depression are strongly correlated, suggesting that tackling one of these factors may help mitigate the others. This insight emphasizes the need for holistic mental health care, where students are provided with integrated services that address multiple mental health challenges simultaneously.

                This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between age and CGPA. It indicates that older students tend to have slightly higher CGPA scores, likely due to increased maturity and experience. However, younger students may experience more stress, leading to lower academic performance. This insight suggests that support programs should be designed to help younger students cope with stress to improve their academic outcomes.
